Hi, I just found the solution yesterday. So try to run this in the terminal

1. pip install --upgrade setuptools
2. sudo apt-get install python2-dev
3. pip2 install pycrypto && pip install distorm3
I you're already done with the crypto.hash, then on the line 3, try to run the pip2 install distorm3. But if your pip2 giving you output error: invalid command 'egg_info'. Then try to download the pip2 using this

1. curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/pip/2.7/get-pip.py --output /tmp/get-pip.py
2. sudo python2 /tmp/get-pip.py
After that try to re-run the first 3 command to install pycrypto and distorm3
